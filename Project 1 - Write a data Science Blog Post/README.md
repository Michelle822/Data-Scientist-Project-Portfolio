## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Within this first project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, I investigated the Stack Overflow data from 2017. Within this data analysis 3 specific questions were answered:


1. Do programmers have equal salary in Europe and North America and is there a 'gender gap'?
1. Do programmers have equal satisfaction score (both career or job) in Europe and North America and is there a 'gender gap'?
1. What are the most common used languages worldwide?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook with the data analysis is available [here](https://github.com/Michelle822/Data-Scientist-Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Write%20a%20data%20Science%20Blog%20Post/Write-A-Data-Science-Blog-Post.ipynb).  
     
You can find the data and other descriptive information
at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/Michelle822/Data-Scientist-Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Write%20a%20data%20Science%20Blog%20Post/Blog.md).
